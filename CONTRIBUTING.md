# Setup
You’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

### Clone this repo

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone git@gitlab.com:gedl/phaser-tiled-physics.git```

### Install node.js and npm

https://nodejs.org/en/


### Install dependencies (optionally you could install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

or if you choose yarn, just run ```yarn```

### Run the demo

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the demo game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


### Build for deployment

Run:

```npm run build```

This will build the plugin.
